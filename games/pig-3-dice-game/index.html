      <h1>How to play Pig 3 dice game</h1>
      <p>
        Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in
        1945. Players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they
        wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their
        gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.
      </p>
      <p>Gameplay</p>
      <div>
        <p>
          Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled
          or the player decides to "hold":
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next
            player's turn.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn
            total and the player's turn continues.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their
            score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The first player to score 200 or more points wins.</p>
        <p>If a player rolls double 1 their total score goes back to 0</p>
        <p>If a player rolls tripple 1 they lose the game</p>
        <p>
          If a player rolls a tripple (other than tripple 1) the number cube
          gets added to the score. (For example for tripple 5, 125 gets added to
          the score )
