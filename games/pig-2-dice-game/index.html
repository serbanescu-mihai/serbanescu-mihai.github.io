      <h1>How to play Pig 2 dice game</h1>
      <p>
        Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in
        1945. Players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they
        wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their
        gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.
      </p>
      <p>Gameplay</p>
      <div>
        <p>
          Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled
          or the player decides to "hold":
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next
            player's turn.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn
            total and the player's turn continues.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their
            score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The first player to score 100 or more points wins.</p>
        <p>If a player rolls double 1 their total score goes back to 0</p>
        <p>
          If a player rolls a double other than double 1 the multiplication of
          the numbers gets added to their score (for example double 3 = 9,
          double 4 = 16, double 5 = 25)
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, the first player, Donald, begins a turn with a roll of 5.
          Donald could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again.
          Donald rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but
          chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 1, and must end his turn without
          scoring. The next player, Alexis, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-6, after
          which she chooses to hold, and adds her turn total of 23 points to her
          score.
